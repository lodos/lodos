👋 Hi, I’m Vlad Ursolov @lodos




👀 I have been professionally involved in full-cycle commercial development, expertise, and optimization of high-load B2B, B2C hardware-software complexes more, then 15 years.




🌱 I am actively programming in various languages (PHP, Python, GoLang, RUST, C#, objC, swift, js, SQL/NoSQL). 

Preferred directions: 

    •	Medicine and improving healthcare quality
    •	E-commerce
    •	Telecommunications, specifically in TV, broadcasting, continuous distance learning, EPG formation and processing, 3D modeling, motion graphics, and post-production. I also have experience in the multiplayer online industry, virtual, and augmented reality using Unity3D and UnrealEngine

    
Technologies:
    
    •	Virtualization
    •	DevOps, CI\CD
    •	BI systems (Yandex.DataLens, Tableau)
    •	Cryptography, Information security
    •	Corporate distributed networks
    •	Blockchain
    •	BigData, AI (CNN, RCNN, RNN), computer vision (CV\MV), machine learning (ML)
    •	Core FFMPEG


I am actively working on automation and digitization of video processes (conversion, processing). Commercial projects are, of course, under NDA. I share here what little I can show.




💞️ I am looking for long-term collaboration in projects related to my preferred directions. Strengths: strategic thinking, desire for personal and professional growth, persistence, responsibility.
